# Ch1: How it all Started
From 2011–14, news was teeming with reports of massive corruption and scams under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA-II) government.


| Scam                                   | Estimated Amount (in INR Crores) | Description                                               |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 2G Spectrum Scam                      | 1,76,000                           | Alleged irregularities in the allocation of 2G spectrum licenses, causing a significant revenue loss to the government. |
| Coal Allocation Scam                  | 1,86,000                           | Accusations of improper allocation of coal blocks, leading to substantial losses to the exchequer. |
| Commonwealth Games Scam               | Over 70,000                        | Allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. |
| AgustaWestland Chopper Scam           | 360 million euros (approx.)      | Accusations of kickbacks and corruption in the procurement of AgustaWestland helicopters for the Indian Air Force. |
| NRHM Scam                             | Hundreds of crores (approx.)       | Allegations of financial irregularities and embezzlement in the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) funds meant for rural healthcare. |
| Cash-for-Votes Scam                   | Not definitively estimated         | Allegations of bribes given to members of Parliament during a vote of confidence in 2008. |
| Tatra Truck Scam                      | Not definitively estimated         | Accusations of corruption and favoritism in the procurement of Tatra trucks for the Indian Army. |

At the end of 2012, the gruesome rape, torture and murder of a young physiotherapy intern, who became widely known as ‘Nirbhaya’, served as the last nail in the UPA government’s coffin for many people.

**Two Leaders Rise**

 - One of the leaders of the India Against Corruption movement, an IIT graduate and former Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer, **Arvind Kejriwal**, launched a new political party, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 - Three-time Gujarat chief minister, **Narendra Modi**, of the BJP
 
In August 2012, a special court in Ahmedabad convicted thirty-two people, including BJP MLA and former cabinet minister Maya Kodnani and Bajrang Dal’s Babu Bajrangi. 16 However, that same year, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Supreme Court of India cleared Modi of any complicity in the violence.


**Kejriwal's Surprising Ascension**

Imagine a political puzzle where no party held the key to power. Delhi's assembly elections in 2013 left everyone scratching their heads. With 28 AAP MLAs, 31 BJP MLAs, and 8 Congress MLAs, it was a hung assembly – a political stalemate. But Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) managed to form the government in an unconventional way.

Here's the plot twist: AAP accepted "unconditional" support from the Congress, a move that raised eyebrows. The government's tenure was short-lived, lasting just forty-nine days, and it ended with Kejriwal's resignation. The reason? The minority government's inability to pass the proposed anti-corruption Jan Lokpal Bill.

**The AntiDefection Law - A Political Straitjacket**

Fast forward to the AntiDefection Law, a legislative straightjacket brought in by Rajiv Gandhi in 1985. This law requires all MPs to vote in alignment with their party's directive, regardless of personal beliefs. Straying from the party line can lead to their removal from office.

This means that when a party decides to support a bill, every MP in that party must vote accordingly. It's a remarkable insight into the inner workings of India's political machinery.

**The Quest for Starred Questions**

In the hallowed halls of Parliament, MPs are keen to have their voices heard. One way to achieve this is by asking "starred questions." Each MP can submit up to ten questions, hoping that at least one of them will make it to the coveted list of twenty starred questions for the day.

Starred questions are unique because they receive oral responses from the concerned minister. This is where MPs can engage in live debate and pose follow-up questions, called supplementary questions.

However, there's a catch – the demand for starred questions far surpasses the supply. With more questions submitted than can be answered, Parliament resorts to a method they call "lottery" to decide which questions get the spotlight.

**Cash for Questions - The Scandalous Sting Operation**

Now, let's delve into the "Cash for Questions" scandal of 2005. Imagine a sting operation that revealed the dark underbelly of parliamentary practices. Eleven MPs were caught accepting bribes from private interests who wanted specific questions asked in Parliament to further their business interests. It was a scandal that shook the foundations of Indian democracy, leading to the expulsion of these erring MPs.

These captivating tales of political maneuvering, legislative strictures, and scandals highlight the complex and sometimes shadowy world of Indian politics. They serve as a reminder that even in the grand halls of democracy, intrigue and controversy are never far from the surface.
